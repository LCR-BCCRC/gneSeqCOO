\usage{
coo_rnaseq(cds)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{- a DESeqDataSet object, with raw counts in the "counts" slot.}

\description{
wrapper for running coo_normalize and coo_predict together
}
\details{
This function is a wrapper for the two core COO prediction functions.
    This function intentionally forces a standard procedure for both 
    normalization and modeling, as this should give us the best chance of 
    the model matching up with our training data.
